	@mainpage Grids API Documentation

	Grids is a library for Unity Game Engine that allows you to setup 
	a variety of grids rapidly. It supports a variety of grid types, 
	including hexagonal and triangular grids. Itâ€™s easy to set 
	your grid up in some standard shapes, to combine shapes, or to define your own. It 
	comes with functionality to easily map grid coordinates to game space: center your 
	grid in a rectangle or align it to an edge. It's easy to flip coordinates, or 
	rotate them so that they conform to your intuition. We designed the library with an
	eye on 2D games, but the grids work just as well in 3D. 

	This is the API documentation. For tutorials and other documentation, 
	see: http://gamelogic.co.za/documentation-contents/ .

	@version 1.7

	Changes:

	Version 1.7
		- Added Mod, Div and Mul methods for all uniform grid points.
		- Added Dot and PerpDot methods for all uniform grid points.
		- Added consistent coloring functions for all built-in grid points.
		- Added spiral iterator for hex grids.
		- Added some LINQ-like methods for grids, as well as GetValue and SetValue methods to make 
			LINQ constructions easier to write.
		- Removed Equals from the declaration of IGridPoint. It is unnecessary, but more importantly
			caused unwanted boxing of points.
		- Added wrapped versions of Rectangular, Diamond, Hexagonal and Triangular Grids. Use the static WrappedX 
			functions to use them.
		- Added a polar maps for Retangular and Hex Grids that can be used with wrapped RectGrids and HexGrids
			to make polar grids.
		- Added some shapes for the Cairo grid.
		- Added a version of AStar that lets you specify the cost, not just the heuristic cost.
		- Fixed a bug with vertex and edge grids that plagued rectangular and diamond grids.
		- Fixed a bug with the canonical positions for hex-point shapes.
		- Simplified the underlying storage mechanism; this makes it easier to construct grids from scratch.
			It also had the result of default shapes changing from ragged rectangles to parallellograms (rect grids' 
			defult shape remains a rectangle).
		- Changed some of the shape functions to make it more intuitive "where" a shape will be in relation to the 
			origin.
		- Made static helper functions in the Op classes that were accidentally exposed private. The public geometric functions provided
			by points should be used instead.
		- Improved the AStar algorithm's run speed and its garabage generation.
		- Removed VectorPoint as implementation base for uniform points, thereby making them slightly faster.
		- Made many improvements to the documentation.		

	Version 1.6
		- Fixed a bug with DiamondGrid's neighbors
		- Added SuperRectGrid
		- Added more point arithmetic for RectGrid
		- Added a grid shuffle method
		- Added an implementation of IList for IGridPoints that is safe t use with the AOT compiler. 
		- Replaced all internal collections with versions that are safe to use with the AOT compiler for iOS.
		- Included compiler hints that can be called to help the AOT compiler include all the necessary code.
		

	Version 1.5
		- Fixed a bug in hex maps that caused hexagon grids with non-regular cells not work correctly.
		- Fixed spelling of some enums that contains the word North. This may break your code :/ but we could not
			deprecate the old enums safely.
		- Moved {edge and vertex} code in {rect and diamond} {grid and point} classes into separate files.

	Version 1.4
		- Reorganised the library slightly to make it possible to export different versions
		of it.

	Version 1.3
		- Added geometry calculations for hex points
		- Fixed wrong spelling of some methods that contains the word Middle. Old methods
		have been made obsolete, so this change should not break your code. 
		- Fixed a bug in one of the 3D to 2D extenion methods provided form Transform.
		- Lots of small code quality improvements under the hood (including a few optimisations).

	Version 1.2
		- Added PolygonMap for handling general polygon-grids
		- Added CairoMap, CairoGrid and CairoPoint as an example of an "exotic" grid.
	
	Version 1.1
		- Added grouping for shape building
		- Added symmetric difference for shape building
		- Added more parallelograms for triangular grids
		- Changed the diamond grid / point coordinate system to be more intuitive
		- Fixed a bug with hexagonal shapes for triangular grids
		- Fixed a bug with composite shape building
		- Fixed a bug with vertex and edge grids
